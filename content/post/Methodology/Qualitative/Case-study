## **Case study**

**Case**: blurred bounded phenomenon with narrative essence  
**Case study**: a process of *systematic comparison*  


### Three fundamental questions

#### What is my case a case of?

- **Empirical categorization.**  
  - Two standards to choose cases
    - genus proximum: choose cases within genus
    - differentia specifica: choose cases based on their specific features
  - Learn cases from different perspectives 

- **Theoretical categorization.**  
  - Using theory to orient case study process
  - Avoid having preconceived assumptions of results, and form theory in nature


#### What is the stuff that a case is made of?

- Use genus proximum and differentia specifica to cut cases into units of analysis and code


#### What do cases do?

- **Describe.** Do-nothing case
- **Interpret.** Interpretative case
- **Enrich theories.** Heuristic case: this kind of case either lacks theories to explain or contradicts with current theories
- **Confirm theories.** Theory-confirming or infirming case
